Tools for DevSecOps Pipeline:

1. Checkov
   - Type: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Compliance Scanning
   - Primary Focus: Security and compliance checks for Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and more.
   - Example Compliance Violation: Exposes hard-coded secrets or insecure configurations (e.g., public S3 buckets in Terraform/CloudFormation templates).

2. TFLint
   - Type: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Compliance Scanning
   - Primary Focus: Linting and syntax checking for Terraform files.
   - Example Compliance Violation: Identifies deprecated resource types, incorrect syntax, or provider-specific issues in Terraform configurations.

3. Clair
   - Type: AMI/Container Image Scanning
   - Primary Focus: Scanning for known vulnerabilities in container images.
   - Example Compliance Violation: Detects CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in OS packages used within Docker images.

4. Trivy
   - Type: AMI/Container Image Scanning
   - Primary Focus: Broader scanning that covers vulnerabilities in container images, OS packages, and open-source software dependencies.
   - Example Compliance Violation: Detects outdated software versions with known vulnerabilities in application dependencies, OS packages, and Docker containers.

5. AWS Config
   - Type: AWS Environment Configuration Scanning
   - Primary Focus: Continuous monitoring of AWS resource configurations.
   - Example Compliance Violation: Detects non-compliant configurations in security groups (e.g., open ports), encryption policies, or resource tagging policies.

6. ScoutSuite
   - Type: AWS Environment Configuration Scanning
   - Primary Focus: Auditing and assessing the security of AWS (and other cloud) environments.
   - Example Compliance Violation: Highlights security misconfigurations in AWS services like IAM roles, S3 permissions, or overly permissive EC2 security groups.
